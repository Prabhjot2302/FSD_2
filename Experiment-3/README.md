By the end of this practical, you will be able to:

1. **Set up and configure React Router** - Implement BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components to enable client-side routing in a React application.

2. **Create navigation using Link and NavLink components** - Use Link for standard navigation and NavLink for active link styling to build user-friendly navigation menus.

3. **Build dynamic route paths with URL parameters** - Utilize route parameters (useParams) to create dynamic routes that capture values from the URL and pass them to components.

4. **Implement programmatic navigation** - Use the useNavigate hook to navigate users between pages based on user actions, form submissions, or conditional logic.

5. **Manage nested routes and layouts** - Create a hierarchical route structure with nested routes and outlet components to maintain consistent layouts across multiple pages.
